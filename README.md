[School Project]</br>
Planivacances i a 3/3 app project made by Maxime Cao & Quentin Barth√©lemy.</br>
The app allow their users to planify their holiday by adding activities to a planning.</br>
It also include viewing the meteo, itinerary, tchat with others, view stats, export the calendar, etc.</br>
This was also the first project where we had to use Jira to plan our different tasks and user stories and split those in sprints.</br>
So we had to apply Agile Scrum method.</br>
</br>
We had to choose the tehnologies used by ourself.</br>
And so we used firebase for authentication, database and push notification system.</br>
We discovered how Rest Api work and how to use those.</br>
</br>
This is the web frontend app in Svelte 3 + Vite + Typescript
